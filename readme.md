This is a [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) Installer that installs (imo) essential Minecraft mods.
I made it because I know people that dislike manually installing Quilt and downloading optimization mods from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com).

It's also a hobby project, since I wanted to dip my toes into Rust.

It installs Quilt, and downloads the following modlists (for any version, if available):

- **Vanilla**: [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), [LazyDFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu), [Ferritecore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferritecore), [Krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton), [Smooth Boot](https://modrinth.com/mod/smoothboot-fabric), [ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast).
- **Visual**: [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights), [Not Enough Animations](https://modrinth.com/mod/not-enough-animations), [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves), [Ears](https://modrinth.com/mod/ears), [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium), [LambdaBetterGrass](lambdabettergrass), [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity), [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris).
- **Optifine**: [Puzzle](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle), [Animatica](animatica), [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium), [Cull Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/cull-leaves), [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity), [LambdaBetterGrass](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdabettergrass), [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures).

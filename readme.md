this is a [quilt](https://quiltmc.org) installer that installs (imo) essential minecraft mods.
i made it because i know people that dislike manually installing quilt and downloading optimization mods from [modrinth](https://modrinth.com).

it's also a hobby project, since i wanted to dip my toes into rust.

it installs quilt, and downloads the following modlists (for any version, if available):

- **vanilla**: [sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), [phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), [lazydfu](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu), [ferritecore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferritecore), [krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton), [immediatelyfast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast).

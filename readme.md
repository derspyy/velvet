This is a [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) Installer that installs (imo) essential Minecraft mods.
I made it because I know people that dislike manually installing Quilt and downloading optimization mods from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com).

It's also a hobby project, since I wanted to dip my toes into Rust.

It installs Quilt, and downloads the following mods (for any version, if available):

- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/AANobbMI)
- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)
- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium)
- [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor)
- [LazyDFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu)
- [Ferritecore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core)
- [Krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton)
- [Smooth Boot](https://modrinth.com/mod/smoothboot-fabric)

I built it in a way that makes it easy to add mod lists, so that I can improve it later with, possibly, multiple profiles, or maybe custom profiles? Who knows.

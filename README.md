This is a Quilt Installer that installs (imo) essential Minecraft mods.
I made it because I know people that dislike manually installing Quilt and downloading optimization mods from Modrinth.

It's also a hobby project, since I wanted to dip my toes into Rust.

It installs quilt, and downloads the following mods (for any version):

- Sodium
- Lithium
- Phosphor
- Lazydfu
- Ferritecore
- Krypton
- Smooth Boot

I built it in a way that makes it easy to add mod lists, so that I can improve it later with, possibly, multiple profiles, or maybe custom profiles? Who knows.
